          <h3 className="text-white text-xl sm:text-2xl md:text-2xl font-semibold mb-2">
            2. Use Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA)
          </h3>
          <p className="text-white text-sm sm:text-base md:text-lg font-light mb-4">
            Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) adds an additional layer of security by requiring users to provide multiple forms of verification. This can significantly reduce the risk of unauthorized access.
            <br/><br/>
            <strong className="font-bold">Importance of MFA:</strong> MFA helps protect against phishing and credential theft by requiring a second form of identification, such as a code sent to your mobile device.
            <br/><br/>
            <strong className="font-bold">Setting Up MFA:</strong> To enable MFA, go to the Azure Active Directory portal, select Security, and configure MFA settings.

          </h3>
          <p className="text-white text-sm sm:text-base md:text-lg font-light mb-4">
            Role-Based Access Control (RBAC) is a key feature in Azure that allows you to manage who has access to your resources and what actions they can perform.
            <br/><br/>
            <strong className="font-bold">Overview of RBAC:</strong> RBAC helps ensure that users only have the permissions necessary for their roles. This principle of least privilege minimizes the potential impact of compromised accounts.
            <br/><br/>
            <strong className="font-bold">Best Practices for Assigning Roles:</strong> Regularly review and adjust roles based on user needs and changes in their responsibilities.

          </h3>
          <p className="text-white text-sm sm:text-base md:text-lg font-light mb-4">
            Encryption is vital for protecting data from unauthorized access. Azure offers several encryption options for data at rest and in transit.
            <br/><br/>
            <strong className="font-bold">Types of Encryption:</strong> Azure provides both server-side encryption (SSE) and client-side encryption. SSE automatically encrypts data stored in Azure services, while client-side encryption encrypts data before it is sent to Azure.
            <br/><br/>
            <strong className="font-bold">How to Enable Encryption:</strong> Configure encryption settings in the Azure portal for your storage accounts and databases.
