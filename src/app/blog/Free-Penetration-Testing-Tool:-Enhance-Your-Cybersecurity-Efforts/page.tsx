        What is Penetration Testing?

        Understanding Penetration Testing
      </h2>
      <p className="mb-4 text-white text-sm sm:text-base md:text-lg font-light">
        Penetration testing, often referred to as "pen testing," is a simulated cyberattack on your computer system, network, or web application. The purpose of penetration testing is to identify vulnerabilities that could be exploited by hackers. Think of it as a safety check for your digital infrastructure.
        <br/><br/>
        Unlike a vulnerability assessment, which merely identifies potential weaknesses, penetration testing involves actively attempting to exploit these vulnerabilities. This proactive approach can reveal the extent to which an attacker could gain unauthorized access and what damage could be done.
