      <h2 className="text-white text-2xl sm:text-3xl md:text-3xl font-bold mb-4">
        The Importance of Cybersecurity for Startups
      </h2>
      <p className="mb-4 text-white text-sm sm:text-base md:text-lg font-light mt-2">
        <strong>Startup Vulnerability:</strong> Startups are particularly vulnerable to cyber-attacks due to their rapid growth and often limited security measures. According to IBM’s 2024 Cost of a Data Breach Report, 43% of cyber-attacks target small businesses, and startups are no exception. With constrained budgets and a focus on scaling operations, startups can inadvertently overlook critical security measures, making them attractive targets for cybercriminals.
      </p>
      <p className="mb-4 text-white text-sm sm:text-base md:text-lg font-light mt-2">
        <strong>Consequences of Breaches:</strong> The ramifications of a cybersecurity breach can be severe. Beyond immediate financial losses—estimated at an average of $4.45 million per breach according to the IBM report—startups can suffer long-term damage to their reputation, loss of customer trust, and potential legal consequences. A report by Verizon highlights that 60% of small businesses close within six months of a significant cyber-attack.
