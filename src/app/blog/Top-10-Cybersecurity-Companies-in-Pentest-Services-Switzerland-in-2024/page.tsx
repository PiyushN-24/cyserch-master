        Hey, ever thought about how much time you spend online? Whether you're scrolling through TikTok, gaming with friends, or just Googling random facts, our lives are pretty much wrapped around the internet. But have you ever wondered how safe your online world really is? With cyber threats getting sneakier every day, keeping things secure isn't just a techie thing it's everyone's responsibility. And that's where penetration testing, or "pentesting," comes in.
        </p>
        <p className="mb-4 text-white text-sm sm:text-base md:text-lg font-light">
        Pentesting is like sending a team of hackers to break into a system, but instead of causing harm, they’re helping to find and fix the security holes. Think of it as having someone check the locks on your doors and windows, making sure no one can sneak in. Today, we're diving into the top 10 companies in Switzerland that are pros at this.
        </p>
        <h2 className="text-white text-2xl sm:text-2xl md:text-3xl font-bold mb-4">
          What is Penetration Testing?

        <h3 className="text-white text-xl sm:text-2xl md:text-2xl font-semibold mb-2">
          Definition and Purpose
        </h3>
        <p className="mb-4 text-white text-sm sm:text-base md:text-lg font-light">
        So, what exactly is pentesting? Imagine you’re in a game where you have to protect a treasure, and someone else is trying to steal it. You'd want to know all the secret entrances they might use, right? That’s what pentesting does for businesses—it finds the weaknesses before the bad guys do.
        </p>
        <p className="mb-4 text-white text-sm sm:text-base md:text-lg font-light">
          According to experts, the cybersecurity industry is booming and is expected to be worth over $300 billion by 2025. That’s huge! And it shows just how important pentesting is in keeping our digital lives secure.

        <p className="mb-4 text-white text-sm sm:text-base md:text-lg font-light">
        Now, let’s talk about the different ways pentesting works:

          External Testing
        </h4>
        <p className="mb-4 text-white text-sm sm:text-base md:text-lg font-light">
          This is all about checking the security of things like websites or servers that are accessible from the outside world. It's like checking how secure the front door of your house is.

        <div className="bg-gray-800 p-4 rounded-lg">
        <h4 className="text-white text-lg sm:text-xl md:text-2xl font-semibold mb-2">
          Internal Testing
        </h4>
        <p className="mb-4 text-white text-sm sm:text-base md:text-lg font-light">
          This is like having a friend come over and see if they can find any hidden entrances from inside your house. It’s all about making sure that even if someone gets in, they can’t do much damage.

        </h4>
        <p className="mb-4 text-white text-sm sm:text-base md:text-lg font-light">

        </h4>
        <p className="mb-4 text-white text-sm sm:text-base md:text-lg font-light">
