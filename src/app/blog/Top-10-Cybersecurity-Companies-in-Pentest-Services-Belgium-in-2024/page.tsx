          What is Penetration Testing?
        </h2>
        <p className="mb-4 text-white text-sm sm:text-base md:text-lg font-light">
        Before we dive into the top companies, let's quickly revisit what penetration testing, or pentesting, entails. Pentesting is a methodical approach to identifying vulnerabilities in your systems by simulating cyberattacks. This process allows you to uncover weaknesses before malicious actors do.
        </p>
        <p className="mb-4 text-white text-sm sm:text-base md:text-lg font-light">
        Heres a brief overview of the different types of pentesting:
        </p>
        <ul className="list-disc list-inside mb-4 text-white text-sm sm:text-base md:text-lg font-light">
          <li><strong>External Penetration Testing:</strong>  Focuses on identifying vulnerabilities in your internet-facing assets, such as web servers or firewalls.</li>
          <li><strong>Internal Penetration Testing:</strong> Assesses the security of your internal networks and systems, simulating a scenario where an attacker has already breached your perimeter.          </li>
          <li><strong>Web Application Penetration Testing:</strong> Examines the security of your web applications, ensuring they are not vulnerable to common attacks like SQL injection or cross-site scripting (XSS).</li>
          <li><strong>Wireless Penetration Testing:</strong> Examines the security of your web applications, ensuring they are not vulnerable to common attacks like SQL injection or cross-site scripting (XSS).</li>
        </ul>

          Why Choose a Belgium Cybersecurity Company?
        </h2>
        <p className="mb-4 text-white text-sm sm:text-base md:text-lg font-light">
