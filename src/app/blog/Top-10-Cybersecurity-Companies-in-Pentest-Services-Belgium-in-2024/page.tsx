          What is Penetration Testing?
        </h2>
        <p className="mb-4 text-white text-sm sm:text-base md:text-lg font-light">
          Penetration testing, or pentesting, involves simulating cyberattacks to identify vulnerabilities in a system before malicious hackers can exploit them. There are several types of penetration testing:
        </p>
        <ul className="list-disc list-inside mb-4 text-white text-sm sm:text-base md:text-lg font-light">
          <li><strong>External Penetration Testing:</strong> Focuses on identifying vulnerabilities in internet-facing assets.</li>
          <li><strong>Internal Penetration Testing:</strong> Evaluates internal network defenses and identifies risks from within.</li>
          <li><strong>Web Application Penetration Testing:</strong> Assesses the security of web applications.</li>
          <li><strong>Wireless Penetration Testing:</strong> Examines the security of wireless networks.</li>
        </ul>
