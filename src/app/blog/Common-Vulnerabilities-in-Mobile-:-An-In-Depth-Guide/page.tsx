            Common Mobile Vulnerabilities
          </h1>

          <h2 className="text-white text-2xl sm:text-2xl md:text-3xl font-bold mb-4">
          1. Unpatched Mobile Operating Systems
        </h2>
        <p className="mb-4 text-white text-sm sm:text-base md:text-lg font-light">
          <strong>Description:</strong> Outdated mobile operating systems (OS) are among the most significant vulnerabilities. When an OS isn't updated regularly, it lacks critical security patches, leaving devices susceptible to known exploits.
          <br />
          <strong>Real-World Example:</strong> In 2023, a vulnerability in Android’s OS allowed attackers to execute arbitrary code on outdated devices, leading to unauthorized access and data breaches.
        </p>
        <ul className="list-disc list-inside mb-4 text-white text-sm sm:text-base md:text-lg font-light">
          <li>Regular Updates: Ensure that mobile devices receive updates as soon as they are available.</li>
          <li>Automated Update Systems: Implement systems that automate updates to minimize delay.</li>
