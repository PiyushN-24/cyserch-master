          <p className="mb-4 text-white text-sm sm:text-base md:text-lg font-light">
            Weak authentication protocols make it easy for attackers to bypass security measures. Weak or outdated authentication methods can expose your network to unauthorized access.
            <br />
            Real-World Example: In 2019, a vulnerability in the Universal Plug and Play (UPnP) protocol allowed attackers to gain control of devices on a network.  <br />Source: <a href="https://www.kb.cert.org/vuls/id/469716" className="text-blue-400 hover:underline">CERT Coordination Center</a>.

          </h3>
          <p className="mb-4 text-white text-sm sm:text-base md:text-lg font-light">
            Unsecured remote access can be exploited by attackers to gain control of network systems. This vulnerability is particularly prevalent with the rise of remote work.
            <br />
            Real-World Example: During the COVID-19 pandemic, many organizations experienced increased attacks due to unsecured remote access solutions. <br /> Source: <a href="https://www.cisa.gov/cybersecurity-covid-19" className="text-blue-400 hover:underline">Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency</a>.

          </h3>
          <p className="mb-4 text-white text-sm sm:text-base md:text-lg font-light">
            Insufficient network segmentation can allow attackers to move laterally across your network once they gain access. Proper segmentation can limit the spread of attacks.
            <br />
            Real-World Example: The Target data breach in 2013 was exacerbated by insufficient network segmentation, which allowed attackers to access sensitive data.  <br />Source: <a href="https://www.target.com/cybersecurity-breach-report" className="text-blue-400 hover:underline">Target Data Breach Investigation</a>.

          <p className="mb-4 text-white text-sm sm:text-base md:text-lg font-light">
            Inadequate Intrusion Detection Systems (IDS) can fail to detect or respond to suspicious activities effectively, leaving your network vulnerable to attacks.
            <br />
            Real-World Example: The Equifax breach in 2017 highlighted the importance of effective IDS, as inadequate monitoring allowed attackers to exploit a vulnerability undetected.  <br />Source: <a href="https://www.equifax.com/data-breach" className="text-blue-400 hover:underline">Equifax Data Breach Report</a>.
