          Penetration testing is a simulated cyberattack conducted to identify vulnerabilities in a system, network, or application. The main goal is to uncover weaknesses that could be exploited by hackers and to provide actionable insights to strengthen your defenses. As cybersecurity threats become more sophisticated, regular pentesting helps businesses stay one step ahead.
