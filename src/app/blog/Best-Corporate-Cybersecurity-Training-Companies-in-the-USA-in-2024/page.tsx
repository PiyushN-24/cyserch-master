        The Rising Tide of Cyber Threats
        </h2>
        <p className="mb-4 text-white text-sm sm:text-base md:text-lg font-light">
        Reflecting on the trends of recent years, we see a staggering increase in cyberattacks. In 2023 alone, there was a 38% rise in cyber incidents compared to the previous year, with ransomware attacks being particularly rampant. Imagine being a CEO who gets the dreaded call—“Weve been hacked.” Its a scenario that no one wants, but far too many have faced. The reality is, the complexity and frequency of these attacks are growing. This makes corporate cybersecurity training not just an investment, but a critical necessity.
        </p>
        <p className="mb-4 text-white text-sm sm:text-base md:text-lg font-light">
        One real-world example comes from a midsize financial firm in Texas. They experienced a ransomware attack that locked down their entire system. The aftermath? A week of lost productivity, a tarnished reputation, and a hefty ransom paid in Bitcoin. What could have made a difference? A well-trained team, equipped to spot the early signs of phishing and other threats.

          Why Cybersecurity Training Matters
        </h3>
        <p className="mb-4 text-white text-sm sm:text-base md:text-lg font-light">
          Cybersecurity training does more than just teach employees about firewalls and passwords. It instills a culture of vigilance and resilience across your organization. Heres how effective corporate cybersecurity training can transform your business:
        </p>
        <ul className="list-disc list-inside mb-4 text-white text-sm sm:text-base md:text-lg font-light">
          <li className="mb-2">
            <strong>Improved Threat Detection:</strong> Your employees become the first line of defense, spotting potential threats before they escalate.
          </li>
          <li className="mb-2">
            <strong>Regulatory Compliance:</strong> Keeping up with industry regulations is non-negotiable. Proper training ensures your company adheres to these standards, avoiding costly fines.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Enhanced Employee Awareness:</strong> A well-trained team reduces the risk of human error, which is often the weakest link in the security chain.
