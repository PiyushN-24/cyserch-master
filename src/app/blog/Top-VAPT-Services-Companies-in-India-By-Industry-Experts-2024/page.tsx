        Understanding VAPT Services: Why They Matter
        </h2>
        <p className="mb-4 text-white text-sm sm:text-base md:text-lg font-light mt-2">
        Vulnerability Assessment and Penetration Testing (VAPT) are vital to any comprehensive cybersecurity strategy. But why exactly are these services so crucial?
        </p>
        <p className="mb-4 text-white text-sm sm:text-base md:text-lg font-light mt-2">
          <strong>Vulnerability Assessment: </strong>This process involves using sophisticated automated tools to identify known vulnerabilities within your systems. By systematically scanning your IT environment, these tools can detect weaknesses before cybercriminals can exploit them. A detailed guide from NIST offers further insights into the importance of vulnerability assessments.
        </p>
        <p className="mb-4 text-white text-sm sm:text-base md:text-lg font-light mt-2">
        <strong>Penetration Testing: </strong>While vulnerability assessments identify weak points, penetration testing simulates real-world attacks to exploit these vulnerabilities in a controlled environment. This helps organizations understand how an attacker might gain unauthorized access and provides actionable insights on how to bolster defenses. The OWASP Penetration Testing Guide is an excellent resource for understanding this process in detail.
