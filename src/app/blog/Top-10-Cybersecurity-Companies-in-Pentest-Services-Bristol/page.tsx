        <h2 className="text-white text-2xl sm:text-2xl md:text-3xl font-bold mb-4">Why Penetration Testing is Crucial ?</h2>
        <p className="mb-4 text-white text-sm sm:text-base md:text-lg font-light">
          Penetration testing is not just a luxury but a necessity in today’s digital landscape. It simulates real-world attacks to uncover vulnerabilities in your systems before malicious actors can exploit them. According to a recent report by IBM, companies that conduct regular pentests reduce their risk of data breaches by 40%.
        </p>
        <p className="mb-4 text-white text-sm sm:text-base md:text-lg font-light">
          In my experience, companies that prioritize pentesting often experience fewer security incidents and higher customer trust. For a deeper dive into why pentesting is essential, check out this <Link href="https://www.cyserch.com/contactus" className="text-blue-400 underline">guide</Link>.
