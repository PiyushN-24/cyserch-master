          <span className="font-bold">Identifying Security Risks: </span>
          A cybersecurity organization plays a critical role in identifying
          security threats before cyber attackers can take advantage of them.
          Businesses find vulnerabilities in networks, apps, and systems by
          doing thorough evaluations and testing. Hence, it is important to
          identify security risks and mitigate them.
        </li>
        <li>
          <span className="font-bold">Security Awareness: </span>
          Hiring a cybersecurity company shows that you prioritize your security
          awareness and proactive risk control. Businesses can prove to their
          clients and other stakeholders that they take security seriously and
          are committed to safeguarding confidential data and assets by
          collaborating with subject-matter experts.

          <span className="font-bold">Obtain Compliance: </span>
          For many firms, a crucial component of cybersecurity is adhering to
          industry norms and standards. Businesses may ensure they comply with
          standards and laws by working with cybersecurity providers to manage
          complex compliance requirements. Therefore, to avoid unnecessary fines
