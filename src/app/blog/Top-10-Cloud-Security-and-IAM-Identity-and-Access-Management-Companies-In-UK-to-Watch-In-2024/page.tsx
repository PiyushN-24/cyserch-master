          Imagine the cloud as a super high-tech storage space where your data lives. But, just like you wouldn’t leave your house unlocked, you don’t want your digital data to be unprotected. Cloud security is like the digital lock that keeps your information safe from hackers and other threats.

            <h3 className="text-xl font-semibold mb-2">Q1. What is cloud security?</h3>
            <p className="text-sm font-light mb-4">
              Ans: Cloud security encompasses a range of policies, technologies, and controls deployed to protect data, applications, and the associated infrastructure of cloud computing. It ensures the confidentiality, integrity, and availability of cloud resources.
            </p>
            <h3 className="text-xl font-semibold mb-2">Q2. Why is IAM important in cloud security?</h3>
            <p className="text-sm font-light mb-4">
              Ans: Identity and Access Management (IAM) is crucial in cloud security because it defines and manages the roles and access privileges of individual network users and the circumstances under which users are granted or denied those privileges. IAM tools and strategies ensure that only the right people have access to the right resources at the right times.
