          </h3>
          <p className="text-white text-sm sm:text-base md:text-lg font-light">
            Injection attacks, such as SQL Injection, occur when untrusted data is sent to an interpreter as part of a command or query. This vulnerability can result in data loss, corruption, and unauthorized access. For instance, in 2023, injection attacks accounted for 20% of all web application vulnerabilities. To protect your applications, implement secure coding practices that validate and sanitize input.

          </h3>
          <p className="text-white text-sm sm:text-base md:text-lg font-light">
            XXE vulnerabilities occur when XML input containing a reference to an external entity is processed by a weakly configured parser. This can lead to the disclosure of internal files, server-side request forgery (SSRF), and denial of service (DoS) attacks. According to the OWASP foundation, XXE vulnerabilities are increasingly being exploited, with a 30% rise in attacks over the past year.
