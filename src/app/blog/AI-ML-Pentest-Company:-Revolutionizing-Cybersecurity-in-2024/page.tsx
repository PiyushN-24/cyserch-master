          Hey there! Imagine if you had a super-smart robot helping you with your homework, spotting mistakes before you even see them. Sounds cool, right? Well, that’s kinda what’s happening in the world of cybersecurity with Artificial Intelligence (AI) and Machine Learning (ML). These tech wonders are shaking things up in a big way, especially when it comes to keeping our digital lives safe from cyber villains. Let’s dive into how AI and ML are transforming penetration testing (pentesting) and why it’s super important for you to understand this tech revolution!
        </p>
        
        <h2 className="text-white text-xl sm:text-2xl md:text-3xl font-bold mb-4">
          What’s the Deal with AI and ML in Cybersecurity?
        </h2>
        <p className="mb-4 text-white text-sm sm:text-base md:text-lg font-light">
          Artificial Intelligence (AI) is like giving computers a brain. They can learn, think, and make decisions, kinda like how you do. Machine Learning (ML) is a part of AI where computers get better at their jobs over time by learning from their experiences—like how you improve in a sport or game the more you practice.
        </p> 
        <p className="mb-4 text-white text-sm sm:text-base md:text-lg font-light">
          In cybersecurity, AI and ML are like having a squad of digital detectives who never sleep. They work round the clock, analyzing tons of data to find out if someone’s trying to sneak into our online accounts or steal sensitive information.
        </p>        
        <h3 className="text-white text-xl sm:text-2xl md:text-3xl font-semibold mb-2">
          Why Are AI and ML So Important in Cybersecurity?
        </h3>
        <p className="mb-4 text-white text-sm sm:text-base md:text-lg font-light">
          Think about it: hackers are getting smarter, and they’re always coming up with new ways to break into systems. Traditional pentesting, where experts manually check for weaknesses, can be slow and sometimes misses things. AI and ML speed things up by automating the process, making sure that no vulnerability goes unnoticed.
        </p>
