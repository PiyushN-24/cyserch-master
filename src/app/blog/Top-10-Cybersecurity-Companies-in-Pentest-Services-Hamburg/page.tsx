        What is Penetration Testing?
      </h2>
      <p className="mb-4 text-white text-sm sm:text-base md:text-lg font-light">
        Penetration testing, or pentesting, is a controlled and simulated cyberattack against an organization's systems, networks, or applications to identify and exploit vulnerabilities before malicious actors can do so. The primary goal of pentesting is to assess the security posture of a system, uncover weaknesses, and provide actionable insights for remediation. It is a proactive measure that helps organizations strengthen their defenses and ensure compliance with industry standards.
        <br /><br />
        Pentesting can be categorized into several types:
      </p>
      <ul className="list-disc list-inside text-white text-sm sm:text-base md:text-lg font-light mb-4">
        <li>Network Pentesting: Evaluates the security of internal and external networks, including firewalls, routers, and switches.</li>
        <li>Web Application Pentesting: Focuses on identifying vulnerabilities in web applications, such as SQL injection, cross-site scripting (XSS), and insecure authentication mechanisms.</li>
        <li>Mobile Application Pentesting: Examines the security of mobile applications across different platforms (iOS, Android) to detect flaws that could be exploited by attackers.</li>
        <li>Social Engineering Pentesting: Tests the organization's susceptibility to human-based attacks, such as phishing or pretexting.</li>
      </ul>
