        Why Corporate Cybersecurity Training is Essential ?
        </h2>
        <p className="mb-4 text-white text-sm sm:text-base md:text-lg font-light">
        Cyber threats are no longer confined to the realm of IT departments; they impact every facet of a business. The latest Cybersecurity Ventures report predicts that cybercrime will cost the world $8 trillion in 2024 a staggering figure that underscores the need for robust security measures. Without proper training, companies risk facing significant financial losses, data breaches, and severe reputational damage
        </p>
        <p className="mb-4 text-white text-sm sm:text-base md:text-lg font-light">
        For instance, a recent attack on a multinational corporation exposed the companys customer data, resulting in a loss of over $100 million and damaging their reputation. This scenario highlights the critical need for comprehensive training programs to prepare employees for potential threats.

        <h3 className="text-white text-xl sm:text-2xl md:text-2xl font-semibold mb-2">
          Compliance and Regulatory Requirements
        </h3>
        <p className="mb-4 text-white text-sm sm:text-base md:text-lg font-light">
        Meeting regulatory standards is another crucial aspect of cybersecurity training. Regulations like GDPR and CCPA impose strict requirements on companies, with hefty fines for non-compliance. For example, failing to adhere to GDPR guidelines can result in fines up to €20 million or 4% of global turnover—whichever is higher. Proper training ensures that your team is aware of these regulations and can effectively implement necessary measures.
