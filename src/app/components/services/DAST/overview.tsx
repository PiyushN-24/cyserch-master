        Dynamic Application Security Testing (DAST) as a Key Security Measure

        Dynamic Application Security Testing (DAST) involves testing running applications for vulnerabilities that could be exploited by attackers. By analyzing applications in real-time, DAST identifies security weaknesses from an external perspective, simulating potential attacks to uncover issues that may not be detected by static analysis. Regular DAST assessments help organizations fortify their applications against threats and ensure robust security.
